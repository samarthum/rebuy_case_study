# Rebuy Case Study

This repository contains the solution (of sorts) for the case study provided by Rebuy.

The problem statement was split across two main categories: Data Analysis and Forecasting. The ask from the data analysis part was to derive some actionable insights, as well as create 4 charts that would go on the daily dashboard of a Category Manager.

Admittedly, I took quite a haphazard approach to the problem and I don't believe I have been able to derive very actionable insights from the given data. I also wasn't able to empathise enough with the role of a category manager to create those 4 charts. Ideally, I would have liked to have a conversation with them in order to understand their perspective, what they know and what they need before going ahead and creating dashboards. 

(Having said that, there are still quite a few visualisations in the notebooks that are contained within this repository.)

The modelling problem was to forecast the 'conversion rate' of each product for the dates 1st January to 7th January, 2021. I had to make an assumption here about the definition of conversion rate because I only started working on this problem on Saturday, and had to submit it by Monday, so there wasn't a window of opportunity to email Carrie to get clarification on this point. 
This was also the first time that I worked on a time series problem. (Haven't gotten the chance to do much of it in the past, at work). Since this was the first time, I tried to extensively use resources available online. The time series modelling tutorial on Kaggle was a good friend. :) (Here[https://www.kaggle.com/learn/time-series])
